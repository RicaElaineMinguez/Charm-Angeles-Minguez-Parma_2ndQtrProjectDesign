# Charm-Angeles-Minguez-Parma_2ndQtrProjectDesign

This project's aim is to recreate the game Chain Reaction (https://brilliant.org/wiki/chain-reaction-game/), with added features such as obstacles (lasers that fire when clicked and randomly appearing meteors â€“ these clear out certain sections of the board) and different shapes for different modes of playing (i.e., the shape you choose affects how quickly and in what directions you are able to gain territory).
